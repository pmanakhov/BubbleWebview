This is a template project for Android Studio that allows you to create an Android wrapper for a Bubble web app in minutes.

### Getting started

Download or clone this repository and import it into Android Studio.

Edit AndroidManifest.xml and MainAcivity.java files. When you'll open them, you'll see 'Put your Bubble URL here' placeholders which you should replace by an actual URL. Note that in AndroidManifest.xml it's enough to add only a host name, e.g. 'name_of_your_project.bubbleapps.io'. You should put the full address starting with https:// in MainAcivity.java.
